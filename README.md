# ðŸ§   Beginner â€“ Python & Data Visualization

This project covers basic data analysis using Python. I worked with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore and visualize data from the **Heart_monitoring.csv** dataset. I performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and created insightful visualizations. The project also includes basic EDA to analyze relationships between different health indicators.
